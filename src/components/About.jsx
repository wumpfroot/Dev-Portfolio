				Front-end developer with an eye for visually beatiful websites that
				scale to all devices. Always excited to learn something new and keep up
				with the new technologies. Along with coding, music and video games are
				close to my heart. If I am not in front of a computer, I am travelling
				around the world to learn about new cultures.
